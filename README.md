# Basic-Security-System
Project work for EEE 4706 (Microcontroller)

This is a fully software-based project done using Assembly Language for the 8051 microcontroller. The coding was done on Mide-51 IDE. The main objective of the project was to implement a basic security system. The system contains a built-in username and password which must match with the username and password given by anymore looking to gain access. A message will pop up based on whether the user manages to gain access or not. The username and password is limited to 8 characters and can be set up within the code.
